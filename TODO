* Add storage.
* Add links.

User Interface Improvements
---------------------------
* Take screenshots of various planet types in EVE.

* Fix all the weird-looking views when the window gets resized.
* User should be able to see extractor heads in the edit extractor window.

-------------------
* Windows
